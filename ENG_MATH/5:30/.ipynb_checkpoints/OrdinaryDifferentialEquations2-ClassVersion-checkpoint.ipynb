    "## Epidemics\n",
    "Let's study a three-way **coupled** ODE. For this, we take a look at a simple model of epidemics proposed first in 1927 by Kermack and McKendrick (Proc. R. Soc. A, 115, 772 (1927)). In order to model the dynamics of populations, we assume that we have three sub-populations $S,I,R$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $S(t)$: the number of people, who are susceptible to the epidemic (the not-yet infected)\n",
    "* $I(t)$: the number of infected people\n",
    "* $R(t)$: the number of people, who are removed from the total population - either because they have become immune or because they die\n",
    "\n",
    "For this SIR-model, we need additional parameters now to describe what happens when one population comes into contact with another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the predator/prey model, we assume that if an infected person from I meets a susceptible person from $S$, $I$ will infect $S$. The rate at which they meet is proportional to $S*I$. Let's call this contact probability $a/N$, where $N$ is the total number of people in the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to say what happens to the people who become infected. Let's assume that there is a certain time period, during which they can pass on the disease, after which they either become immune or (sadly) die. This process is governed by another time constant $b$ and takes away people from $I$ and adds to $R$.\n",

    "## More Chaos\n",
    "Alright, now that we've encountered chaotic behavior in a rather \"simple\" system, let's check one of the more famous systems that is associated with this phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1960s, Edward Lorenz was investigating models of weather processes. These were (and are) often modeled as highly coupled, dynamic systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just to scare people, the very, very simplified equations that were used as the start are derived from thinking about convection, that is, the distribution of temperature in a volume. This was already studied by Rayleigh in the early 1900s, assuming a layer of fluid, in which the top is held at a constant temperature difference from the bottom. Assuming, that motion in the fluid can only occur parallel to the x-z-plane, one can then write the following two partial derivative equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\nabla^2\\psi=-\\frac{\\partial(\\psi,{\\nabla}^2\\psi)}{\\partial(x,z)}+\\nu{\\nabla}^4\\psi+g\\alpha\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x}$\n",
    "* $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\theta=-\\frac{\\partial(\\psi,\\theta)}{\\partial(x,z)}+\\frac{\\Delta T}{H}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}+\\kappa{\\nabla}^2\\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\psi$ is a stream function for two-dimensional motion, $\\theta$ is the departure of temperature from the temperature in the state of no convection (the steady state), $g$ is the gravitational constant, $\\alpha$ the coefficient of thermal expansion, $\\nu$ the kinematic viscosity, and $\\kappa$ the thermal conductivity of the liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to study these rather intricate equations, Lorenz first simplified these to a set of three equations, by assuming that it is possible to write the solutions $\\psi,\\theta$ as oscillations in x-z:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\psi \\approx X(t)\\sin(x)\\sin(z)$\n",
    "* $\\theta \\approx Y(t)\\cos(x)\\sin(z)-Z(t)sin(z)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This yields the now-famous Lorenz equations, relating three convection states $X(t),Y(t),Z(t)$ with three parameters $s,r,b$ to each other. The equations are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\frac{dX}{dt}=s*(Y-X)$\n",
    "* $\\frac{dY}{dt}=r*X - Y - X*Z$\n",
    "* $\\frac{dZ}{dt}=X*Y - b*Z$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this system, $X$ describes the intensity of the convection, $Y$ describes the temperature difference between rising and falling currents, and $Z$ describes the distortion of the vertical temperature profile from linear (i.e., the steady-state). $s=\\frac{\\nu}{\\kappa}$ is the Prandtl number, $r$ is related to the Rayleigh number that chacterizes turbulent flow, and $b=2.667$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of equations is only accessible numerically, and in addition one should not forget is only a very crude approximation of the original partial derivative equation!\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, Lorenz proceeded to test solutions to this on a computer. One day, after the computer had printed out a set of solutions, Lorenz wanted to continue at a previous time-point. Not wanting to re-run the whole simulation (which had taken days to compute!), he entered the rough numbers from the print-out and re-started the calculation at that time. When he came back, the solution to the ODEs had diverged drastically, even though the initial values were very close together. When investigating the properties of this system in more detail, he found out that arbitrarily-close initial solutions would end up at arbitrarily-far points later in phase space - the Butterfly effect!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will implement this system and show the evolution of the three system parameters over time."

    "\n",
    "Let's say that these equations are a good model of weather (after all, convection of temperature is a big part of weather mechanics). Now, we have seen that initial values tend to get spread out after time. So, how close do they need to be in order for us to get reliable prediction accuracies? \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, let's assume that reliable predictions for four days of weather would be possible with an initial accuracy from 1000 weather stations evenly distributed over the earth's surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then the \"chaos\" inherent in these equations tell us that an equally reliable forecast for 11 days the number of required weather stations increases to 100 million stations. And for predictions over a whole month, an amount of 10^20 stations would be needed - one per 5 square millimeters of earth surface!"
